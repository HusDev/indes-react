## About us

- We are a group of students from Harbour.Space University Barcelona who are designing an app that aims to make it easier for people to discover the city of Barcelona. Our app's goal is to simplify the process of making a decision in the face of the overwhelming number of options. We are in our early stages, but we are eager to expand and improve! If you believe in our vision and want to support us, please take a few minutes to fill out our short survey.
